## Data science Docker container

This is a 'work in progress' Docker container built with Ubuntu linux containing a number of common Python data science packages. I aim to be able to deploy this on high performance computing clusters. Currently, it's not running a Jupyter hub or developer IDE. It's Vim or bust ;) 

### Python3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* scikit-learn
* scipy
* numpy
* R

### Unix tools
* vim
