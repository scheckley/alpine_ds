## Data science Docker container

This is a 'work in progress' Docker container built with Ubuntu linux containing a number of common Python data science packages. I aim to be able to deploy this on high performance computing clusters. Currently, it's not running a Jupyter hub or developer IDE. It's Vim or bust ;)
